# borefield: A open-source tool for borefields for Python

## What is *borefield*?
*borefield* is a Python module for both the sizing of geothermal borefields and plotting the temperature profile of the ground. It can calculate the required depth of the borefield, based on the borehole configuration, ground parameters, a monthly load profile and a temperature limitation. Also given a load and a certain field, it can plot the temperature profile.
