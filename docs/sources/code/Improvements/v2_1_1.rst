v2.1.1
***************
Due to the implementation of the GFunction class in GHEtool, a substantial speed improvement is made w.r.t. GHEtool v2.1.0 for computationally expensive tasks.
In the tables below, one can find this speed improvement for the different sizing methods and for several of the examples documents. The results can be recreated by running the code below.
The computational times as shown in the table below, are an average of 5 runs.
