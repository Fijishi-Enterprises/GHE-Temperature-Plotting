GHEtool has a couple of different functionalities, all centered around borefield sizing.
In the examples listed below, one can find example code on how to use the different functionalities.

- Sizing the borefield (i.e. calculating the required depth) for a given injection and extraction load for the borefield (three sizing methods are available).
