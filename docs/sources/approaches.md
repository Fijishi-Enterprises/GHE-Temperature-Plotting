# Overview over scaling approaches

The different approaches available are:

* The linear approach scaling the original time series to their average using either a given scaling factor or a determined one calculated by the given 
  simultaneity factor. Further explanations can be found here: {doc}`linear_approach`
* The scaling approach {doc}`scaling_apporach`
* The normal distribution approach {doc}`scaling_apporach`
