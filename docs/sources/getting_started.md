# Getting started

In the following, instructions for installing and using the tssm package on Windows are given. The installation instructions for installing and using tssm 
on Linux/macOS systems are however quite similar and can be, hopefully easily, derived from the instructions below.

## tssm installation

You can also directly install tssm package from PyPi with the following command:

```console
pip install GHEtool
```

Alternatively, download or clone a local copy of the repository to your computer:

```console
git clone https://github.com/wouterpeere/GHEtool
```

And afterwards install (in the folder where the setup.py is located) as editable using:

```console
pip install -e .
```

or install directly via python as


```console
python setup.py install
```
