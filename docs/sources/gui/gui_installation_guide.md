Please note that depending on your company's security policy, a Windows Defender warning might pop-up when installing GHEtool.
Since GHEtool is a rather new software, it is not yet recognised by Windows Defender SmartScreen, therefore it says that the publisher is unknown. By pressing 'more information' you can still install the software. After a while, this problem will be solved since Windows will learn to recognise GHEtool.
